# Circle of Parity #

Welcome to the NFL "Circle of Parity" creator. A circle of parity is a visual indicator of how truly evenly matched all the teams in the NFL are from year to year. 

In a circle, each team is placed counter-clockwise from a team it beat and clockwise from a team it lost to. By following the chain of teams on the circle either clockwise or counter-clockwise you can show that by the transitive property, any one team is simultaneously better **and** worse than any other team. 

All years from 2009 to the present are included. No circle is possible for 2017, however, as the Cleveland Browns went 0-16 that year.
